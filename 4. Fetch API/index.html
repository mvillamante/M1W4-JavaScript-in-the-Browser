            // Checkpoint 4.1 What are HTTP requests and reponses? What are the various HTTP verbs and what do they do?
            // Answer: HTTP requests are messages sent by the client to initiate an action on the server. Responses are messages returned by the server to provid the result of the requested action.
            // HTTP verbs include GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT(update data), DELETE (delete data), etc.

            // Todo 4.2 Fetch the information about a single user. Display their information

            // Todo 4.3 Create a user

            // Todo 4.4 Update the information of the user that you have created

            // Todo 4.5 Delete the user that you have created

            // Checkpoint 4.2 What is the difference between callbacks, then-catch vs await-try-catch? When should you use one over the other
            // Answer: Callbacks and then-catch are traditional ways of handling asynchronous code, while await-try-catch is a more modern and readable approach.
            // Use await-try-catch for better readability and error handling, especially in async functions
